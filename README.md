# expenses-tracker-backend

This repo is in the early stages of development.

This will be a backend express server for the Expenses tracker app https://github.com/JoeDodgson/expenses-tracker.

I plan for this server to handle CRUD requests and to contain a data access layer to make changes to a database which backs the application.
